Other than the lack of off-chain voting, which you flagged in your README, this is a solid and secure contract. I checked for vulnerabilities including modifying active proposals, multi-proposing, quorum arithmetic, and execution re-entrancy, and didn't spot anything. I only have a couple of code quality suggestions.

[Q-1] NFT buying can be simplified by adding a single buyNFT function to the Governmor

Rather than having standalone `createBuyNFTProposal` and `executeBuyNFT` functions, which are wrappers around `createProposal` and `execute` that create a proposal to buy the NFT at the current price, consider adding a function to the Governor which calls the NFT marketplace to purchase at a fixed or maximum price. For example, a signature like:

```
buyNFT(address nftAddress, uint nftId, uint256 maxPrice)
```

which in turn calls the NFT marketplace.

Then members can submit proposals that call function, like they would create any other proposal, using the main `createProposal` function. This would reduce the amount of code since we don't need to encode proposals ourselves.

In addition, it allows for more flexibility in execution price, if desired. Rather than executing at a fixed price (which the member can determine themselves by looking up prices when proposing), we can set a maximum price and have the buyNFT function dynamically fetch price at execution time and ensure it's less than the maximum.

[Q-2] Unclear why we start proposals 13 minutes in the future

On line 125 in `createProposal`, we set the start time of proposals to be in the future:

```
_proposal.startTime = block.timestamp + 13 minutes;
_proposal.endTime = block.timestamp + 7 days;
```

This requires us to track an extra time based state variables for proposal, as well as an extra `PreActive` status.

As a reader it's unclear why the start time is in the future, and why it's 13 minutes specifically. Consider adding a comment explaining this choice.
